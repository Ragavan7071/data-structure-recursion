# data-structure-recursion
# c++ program
to Write a function with one positive integer parameter called n. The function will
write 2^n-1 integers (where ^ is the exponentiation operation). Here are the
patterns of output for various values of n:
n=1: Output is: 1
n=2: Output is: 1 2 1
n=3: Output is: 1 2 1 3 1 2 1
n=4: Output is: 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1
And so on. Note that the output for n always consists of the output for n-1,
followed by n itself, followed by a second copy of the output for n-1.
